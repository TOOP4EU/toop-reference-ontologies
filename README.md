TOOP Common Semantic Model

Semantic interoperability (SIOp) is dependent on two distinct characteristics: firstly, each stakeholder under collaboration has the responsibility to make explicit her meaning of the introduced concepts. This can be achieved by either developing/stating one's own concept definitions, or reusing existing definitions. Either way, a semantic model emerges for each stakeholder. Secondly, a stakeholder needs to align its own semantic model with the semantic model of one's counterpart in the collaboration. This can be achieved by either aligning directly with the semantic model of one's counterpart in the collaboration, or, by aligning with an intermediate semantic model that both stakeholders deem appropriate. 

The TOOP Common Semantic Model (TOOP CSM) represents such an intermediate model, and is defined by the The Once-Only Principle project. The TOOP CSM represents a container for several ontologies and vocabularies that relate to each other, but remain separate in an attempt to adhere to the architectural principles of Separation of Concerns and Transparency. Where possible, the ontologies are founded on existing ones as using logical subsumption and equivalence. 

Currently, the TOOP CSM consists of the following parts:
1. Registered Organization
